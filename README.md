## Basics: Practice for SASS, Authentication, and Authorization

By Hubert F. Espinola I

## Note:

This one is made for time killin' nothing more... fleece don't judge me hehe... I'll be posting this soon on heroku, and leave some vulnerabilities (Best
in CSRF... take advantage on opensource code w/env variables... lol), so you can practice for CTFs too!

Start server by: `node app.js`, view page on: `http://localhost:5050/`

## Hints for vulnerabilities:
- Server uses JWT... analyze the cookies
- Check the Routes!!!
